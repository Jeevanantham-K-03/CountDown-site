This project is intended for practice and review purposes, and runs locally in the browser.

---

### Project Structure

CountDown-site/│

├──
count.html # Main HTML file that displays the countdown

├──
style.css # Styles for layout and responsive design

└──
script.js # JavaScript logic for countdown functionality


### Features

- Displays a live countdown to a fixed date/time.  
- Responsive design (works across desktop and mobile).  
- Lightweight – no external libraries or frameworks used.  


### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jeevanantham-K-03/CountDown-site.git


2. Open the project folder:

cd CountDown-site


3. Run the site locally by opening count.html in your browser.

### Notes

- The countdown target date is hardcoded in script.js.

- The script does not handle expiry behavior (when the timer reaches zero, it will stop at 0:0:0).

- No user input for date/time is required.

### Preview (Optional)

### Future Improvements

- Add expiry behavior (e.g., show a message when time runs out).

- Allow users to set their own countdown date/time.

- Improve animations and design for better UI.
